# This is a repo for my first Project HOG

## Brief Description

This project implements a simulator for the two-player dice game **Hog**, where players alternate turns to reach 100 points first. The game includes several special rules such as Pig Out, Free Bacon, Hog Wild, and Swine Swap, which add strategic depth. You will build and test game logic in `hog.py`, and develop increasingly advanced strategies to compete against a baseline strategy. A graphical user interface (GUI) is included to play the game visually once the logic is complete. The project emphasizes use of control structures, higher-order functions, and simulation techniques.
